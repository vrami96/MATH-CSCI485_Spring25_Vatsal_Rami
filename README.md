# Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with Linear Regression

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** using **Linear Regression** on the **Diabetes dataset** from scikit-learn. RFE is a feature selection method that removes less significant features step-by-step to improve model performance and interpretability.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset contains **10 features** and a **target variable** representing diabetes progression one year after baseline.

### **Features:**
- Age (`age`)
- Sex (`sex`)
- Body Mass Index (`bmi`)
- Blood Pressure (`bp`)
- Six blood sample-derived quantitative variables

### **Target:**
- A continuous variable measuring disease progression.

## ðŸš€ Installation
Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib fpdf
